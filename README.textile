h1. GoDaddy Reseller API 0.0.1

Connect with your app to the GoDaddy Reseller API to automatically buy and sell domains and such!

h2. Usage

<pre>
  godaddy = GoDaddyReseller::API.new('username', 'password') # usually in an initializer
  godaddy.authenticate # tests your login credentials
  godaddy.run_certification # runs the cerfication script, required to open a production reseller account
</pre>


h2. Installation

To enable the library your Rails 2.1 (or greater) project, use the gem configuration method in "<code>config/environment.rb</code>"

<pre>
Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
  config.gem 'uuid' # UUID required by this gem, for now 
  config.gem 'thrivesmart-godaddy_reseller_api', :lib => 'godaddy_reseller_api', :source => 'http://gems.github.com'
end
</pre>

The <code>:lib</code> is important, because rails gets confused when the name of the gem is different from the library.

And of course, run 

<pre>
  rake gems:install
</pre>

To get them installed on your system.

Optionally, to unpack it into your application, just run:

<pre>
  rake gems:unpack GEM=thrivesmart-godaddy_reseller_api
</pre>
